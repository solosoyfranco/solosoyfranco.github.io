# Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

This blog is currently **in progress**. Over the next few weeks, Iâ€™ll begin migrating many of my personal notes, experiments, and technical documentation from **Obsidian & Notion** to this public space â€” in hopes that some of it may help others too.

Topics will range from:

- IT infrastructure, DevOps, homelabs  
- Software development (Python, React, Django, etc.)  
- Cybersecurity, networking, automation  
- 3D printing, electronics, and side projects  
- Some AI, LLMs, and personal growth  

Thanks for stopping by. More coming soon..
