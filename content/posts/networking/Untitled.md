diag debug cli 6
diag debug enable
# Then perform actions via GUI
```

### **Search configuration in CLI**

```bash
show full | grep "test 123"
show full | grep "test 123" -r
show | grep "test 123"
```

## **‚úÖ Other Tips**

- Always set up **backup email alerts** and test them.
    
- Export configurations regularly.
    
- Use **policy descriptions** to document what each rule does.
    
- Segment networks by VLAN/interface as much as possible.
    
- Prefer **static routes** for site-to-site VPNs when possible.
    
* Enable DNS Server
